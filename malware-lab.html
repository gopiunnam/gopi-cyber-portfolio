  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    I built an isolated malware analysis lab to safely study malware behavior, identify indicators of compromise (IOCs),
    and improve detection logic. The lab supports both static and dynamic analysis and uses monitoring tools to observe
    network and host-level activity.

  <h2>Tools Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Wireshark</li>
    <li>Security Onion</li>
    <li>Splunk</li>
    <li>Windows/Linux VMs (isolated environment)</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What I Did</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Created a fully isolated lab environment for safe malware testing.</li>
    <li>Performed static and dynamic analysis on sample executables.</li>
    <li>Observed network traffic and system activity to detect malicious behavior.</li>
    <li>Collected IOCs and documented findings to improve threat detection.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Outcome</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Improved understanding of malware execution patterns and attacker techniques.</li>
    <li>Built repeatable analysis steps useful for incident response and detection engineering.</li>
    <li>Created documentation that can be used for SOC reporting and future lab expansion.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Next Improvements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Add screenshots of Splunk dashboards and Security Onion alerts.</li>
    <li>Publish a short write-up: “How I Built My Malware Analysis Lab”.</li>
    <li>Include IOC examples and detection rule notes (sanitized).</li>
  </ul>
